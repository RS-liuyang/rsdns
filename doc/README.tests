README unbound tests

There is a test setup for unbound. Use
	make test
To make and run the tests. The results are summarized at the end.

You need to have the following programs installed and in your PATH.
* dig - from the bind-tools package. Used to send DNS queries.
* splint (optional) - for lint test
* doxygen (optional) - for doc completeness test
* ldns-testns - from ldns examples. Used as DNS auth server.
* xxd and nc (optional) - for (malformed) packet transmission.
The optional programs are detected and can be omitted.

Without any support programs, unittest and testbound can still be used.
	(cd testdata; ../testcode/mini_tpkg.sh exe 02-unittest.tpkg)
	(cd testdata; ../testcode/mini_tpkg.sh exe 03-testbound.tpkg)

testdata/ contains the data for tests. 
testcode/ contains scripts and c code for the tests.

do-tests.sh : runs all the tests in the testdata directory.
testbed.sh : compiles on a set of (user specific) hosts and runs do-tests.

Tests are run using testcode/mini_tpkg.sh.
